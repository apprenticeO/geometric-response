# Geometric Response – Companion Code and Proofs

This repository contains the formal proofs, numerical scripts, and minimal data
supporting the paper:

> **From Microscopic Structural Interdependence to Causal Dispersive Geometry**  
> Ovidiu Tataru, 2025  
> Source LaTeX: `12_TRIAD_Geometry/Latex/From Microscopic Structural Interdependence to Causal Dispersive Geometry.tex`

The paper develops a Green–Kubo → Kramers–Kronig chain from the microscopic
structural observable \(\Pi(t)=\sqrt{F_Q}\,S\,I\) to a causal, frequency–dependent
geometric response \(G_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega)=G_0\,\chi(\omega)\).  
This repository packages:

- a complete Lean 4 formalization of the analytic and conservation theorems, and  
- the minimal Python tooling and sample data needed to reproduce the GK/KK
  diagnostics and Debye fits used in the manuscript.

## Contents

- `Geometric_Response_Lean/`  
  Lean 4 project `GeometricResponseLean`:
  - Green–Kubo to Kramers–Kronig necessity (GK→KK small‑\(\omega\) slope),
  - Debye single–pole sufficiency and passivity,
  - flat–space conservation for polynomial \(G(\Box)\),
  - convolution‑kernel conservation (CTP viewpoint),
  - Wiener–Khinchin \(S(0)=2\tau_G\),
  - Paley–Zygmund positivity and \(\tau_G>0\),
  - plus two explicit physics axioms (short‑time variance bound and \(L^1\)
    autocorrelation under H1–H3).

- `scripts/`  
  Geometry–response pipeline and diagnostics:
  - `generate_ou.py`, `generate_lindblad_qubit.py`: construct OU and Lindblad
    benchmark time series \(\Pi(t)\),
  - `compute_gk_kk.py`, `fit_debye.py`, `write_debye_chi.py`, `write_scales.py`:
    Green–Kubo integrals, KK slopes, Debye fits, and derived scales
    \(\{\tau_G,\omega_G,\lambda_G,m_G\}\),
  - `chain_two_qubit_pipeline.py`, `run_two_qubit_demo.py`,
    `test_two_qubit_lwss_passivity.py`, `verify_transfer_identity.py`:
    two–qubit structural tests and passivity checks,
  - `build_tensor_transfer_dataset.py`, `synthesize_response_from_rinfo.py`,
    `export_rmunu_diagnostic.py`, `calibrate_G0.py`:
    tensor response datasets and \(G_0\) calibration,
  - `utils.py`, `QuantumTriadVisualizer.tsx`: shared helpers and visualization.

- `dynamics/`  
  Minimal triad‑dynamics scripts that generate representative \(\Pi(t)\)
  trajectories used as structural input for the geometry pipeline:
  TEBD/XXZ examples, active–epoch density tests, and Paley–Zygmund validation.

- `tests/`  
  Stand‑alone diagnostics that mirror the “assumptions & tests” table in the
  paper (LWSS / stationarity, flatness and \(\tau_{\mathrm{PSD}}\),
  finite‑record bias, multi‑window \(\tau_G\), and violation cases).

- `data/`  
  Small, curated CSV/PNG snapshots for:
  - `baseline/`: OU baseline GK/KK checks and Debye fit,
  - `lindblad/`: Lindblad‑qubit GK/KK checks,
  - `violation/`: violation summary and plots.
  Large raw time–series files are **not** included; they can be regenerated
  by running the scripts.

## How This Relates to the Paper

- Theorems about the GK→KK link, Debye sufficiency, conservation, and
  Wiener–Khinchin are **fully machine‑verified** in Lean 4
  (see `Geometric_Response_Lean/PROVEN_VS_PAPER.md` for a line‑by‑line map
  between LaTeX statements and Lean theorems).
- The Python scripts implement exactly the GK/KK estimator pipeline,
  Debye fits, and diagnostic plots described in Appendices A–B of the paper.
- The `data/` directory contains the minimal numerical artifacts needed to
  reproduce the figures and tables referenced in the appendices without
  shipping multi‑hundred‑MB raw traces.
